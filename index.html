                    <h2>Who is Nolan Johnson?</h2>
                    <p>That's a big question, but here is a professional snapshot:</p>
                    <p>I've been obessed with sales and marketing for the last 8 years. Understanding people, how they think, and how to create valuable offers to problems people are experience. It's like this grand puzzle that once solved has a satisfying value exchange.</p>
                    <p>Over the years I've marketed and sold various offers from freelance marketing services, fitness gyms, growth consulting for Saas companies, real estate services, ecommerce, and local brick and mortar retail. Working with tech companies was by far the most exciting.</p>
                    <p>This year I realized that I don't want to look back in 60 years and regret not pursuing what I've always really wanted to do. Work in Technology.</p>
                    <p>To me it's the most beautiful triology of leverage, efficiency and impact when done properly. It just fits me. So rather than looking back in 60 years and thinking "I wish", I decided to add coding to my bag of skills.</p>
                    <p>This website documents my journey as my pivot to technology progresses.</p>
