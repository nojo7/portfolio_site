                <h2>Obligatory Self-Promoting Bio With A Photo That Shows Off How Happy I Am - Theme By Instagram</h2>
                <p>I've been obessed with sales and marketing for the last 8 years. Understanding people, how they
                    think, and how to create valuable offers to problems that people experience. It's like this grand
                    puzzle that once solved has a satisfying value exchange.</p>
                <p>That obession led to marketing and selling many offers from freelance marketing, fitness gyms, growth
                    consulting for SaaS companies, real estate services, ecommerce, to brick and mortar retail.
                    Truthfully all but tech were agonizing to work on.</p>
                <p>This year I reflected on that and realized I don't want to look back in 60 years and regret not
                    pursuing what I've always really wanted to be involve in. Technology.</p>
                <p>To me it's the most beautiful triology of leverage, efficiency and impact when done properly. It just
                    fits me. So rather than looking back in 60 years and thinking "I wish", I decided to add coding to
                    my bag of skills and see where it takes me.</p>
                <p>This website documents my journey as my pivot to technology progresses.</p>
